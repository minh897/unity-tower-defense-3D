# Tower-Defense-3D
A basic 3D tower defense game developed in Unity as a solo project to strengthen foundational game programming skills. This project is based on a guided tutorial and covers core gameplay systems such as enemy pathfinding, tower behaviors, wave management, and UI integration. Built with Unity 6.

## Features
- Enemy AI with pathfinding (NavMesh-based).
- Tower placement system with attack logic.
- Wave spawning and progression system.
- Score tracking and basic game loop.
- Modular UI elements (health, wave count, etc.).
- Basic animations and visual effects.
- Performance optimization using Unity Profiler.

## Purpose
This project was built while following a tutorial series to:
- Learn and reinforce Unity fundamentals.
- Pratice and writing reusable and organized C# code.
- Understand common gameplay systems in tower defense mechanics.
- Get hands-on experience with Unityâ€™s component-based architecture.
